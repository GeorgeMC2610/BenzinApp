# BenzinApp

This app is designed to help you keep track of your car's statistics such as fuel efficiency and cost. By inputting data for each fill up, the app will calculate your car's liters per 100 km, km per liter, and cost per km. The app also provides visual graphs to help you visualize your car's statistics over time.

## Features

+ Input and store data for each fill-up including kilometers driven, liters of fuel, and cost.
+ Automatically calculate and display fuel efficiency statistics such as liters per 100 km, km per liter, and cost per km.
+ View visual graphs to track your car's statistics over time.
+ Keep track of the car's malfunctions and services.
+ Calculate a one-time travel cost and consumption.
+ Calculate repeating trips' cost and consumption over the course of weeks.

**IMPORTANT WARNING:** This app is still in its alpha phase. It's highly recommended to __**backup all of your fuel fill records**__ in some other program (e.g. Excel) and not solely use this app to track your statistics. **Also please be aware that the app might crash a lot**.
