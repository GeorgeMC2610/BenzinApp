BenzinApp's official repository for the **X-Platform Mobile App** version, written in Dart using Flutter. Development starts and ends here! Anything related to the app will be found in this very repository! Read about the app below, for more info!

### Registering
To create an account, please use an email address that you have access to. This is important to ensure your account can be successfully verified. Register with your email in the app, then follow the instructions sent to your inbox to complete the confirmation process.
Make sure you've read the Terms and Conditions along with the Privacy Policy, before registering.

### Logging in
If you already own an account, you can log in **using your already existing credentials.** In any case where you don't have access to them, you can recover them **using the "I forgot my password button".** Make sure you have access to your registered e-mail, so you can follow the instructions properly.

## How to Use
This app is targeted to people who own/share a vehicle (car/motorcycle/truck or anything else) **that contains an internal combustion engine** (all kinds of hybrid cars count). If your car is 100% electric, **this app is not useful for you**.

### Legacy Users
In its pre-alpha phase, this app didn't support e-mail registering, or sharing cars with others. Users that shared a car, used to have one account for the car and share the credentials. This means that every account represented a single car. **If you're a legacy user** you can  retrieve your old car's data, by entering the old credentials in the corresponding prompt. **Once you confirm your account, click that you ***were*** a BenzinApp-BETA user when asked.** You can also access this prompt from the settings as well.

### Creating a vehicle
Create a vehicle by selecting the "Add Car" button in the Dashboard. Once you've eneter your car's data, you can proceed with adding its data! You'll be asked to input:
- A nickname for your car
- Car make
- Car model
- Manufacturing year

### Invitations / Not owning a vehicle
Once you've successfully registered and confirmed your account, share your username with other users to together the vehicle's data! To invite a user to a car, follow the steps:
- [DASHBOARD]: Click the kebab menu of the car you want to share
- [CAR PAGE]: Head to the "invitations" tab (the envelope icon in the bottom far-right)
- Enter the usrername of the User you want to share the car with
- The recipient must accept the invitation

⚠️ **Important**: The recipients of a invitation to a car, can modify, add and **delete** the already existing data. Make sure that you know who you share the car with and that you trust them!

## Data Input

### Fuel Fills
Log every fuel refill, including date, quantity, cost, and mileage. This helps track fuel consumption, expenses, and efficiency over time. You'll be asked to input:
- The mileage the car has since the last time you topped up
- The **total** mileage the car has at the moment (optional, helps with calculating the metric above more accurately)
- The cost of the fuel
- The amount of liters you topped up
After that, you may see your data being immediately calculated, about this specific fuel fill

### Malfunctions
Record vehicle issues or breakdowns as they occur. This section helps users monitor recurring problems and maintain a history of reported malfunctions.

### Services
Track maintenance and service activities such as oil changes, inspections, or repairs. Keeping this information up to date helps ensure vehicle reliability and timely servicing. You can also track:
- When the next one will be (mileage)
- How much mileage the car has left before the next service
- What happened in this specific service

### Trips
Log individual trips with relevant details such as **distance**, **places**, and **purpose**. This section supports travel history tracking and usage analysis. You'll be **prompted to select locations in Google Maps, ** by entering the address or by long-pressing on the map.
