# BenzinApp

BenzinApp's official repository for the **X-Platform Mobile App** version, written in Dart using Flutter.

## Getting Started
Currently, the app is **unavailable** to be installed from any official store (Google Play Store/Apple Store). So, in order to install it, you must download the .apk version, which is only **available for Android**. To install it in your Android Device, navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/GeorgeMC2610/BenzinApp/releases) and download the **latest version**.

### 1. Logging in or Signing up
If you haven't already, created an account, navigate to the Register page of the app and create an account. **Currently, an account consists of a username-password combination**.
Enter you car's info and you'll be navigated to the home page.
