# BenzinApp

This app is designed to help you keep track of your car's statistics such as fuel efficiency and cost. By inputting data for each fill up, the app will calculate your car's liters per 100 km, km per liter, and cost per km. The app also provides visual graphs to help you visualize your car's statistics over time.

## Features

+ Input and store data for each fill-up including kilometers driven, liters of fuel, and cost.
+ Automatically calculate and display fuel efficiency statistics such as liters per 100 km, km per liter, and cost per km.
+ View visual graphs to track your car's statistics over time.
+ Keep track of the car's malfunctions and services.
+ Calculate a one-time travel cost and consumption.
+ Calculate repeating trips' cost and consumption over the course of weeks.

**IMPORTANT WARNING:** This app is still in its alpha phase. It's highly recommended to __**backup all of your fuel fill records**__ in some other program (e.g. Excel) and not solely use this app to track your statistics. **Also please be aware that the app might crash a lot**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this app, you will need an Android device running Android 8.0 or later, with access to the internet. You might also be requested to turn on some permissions to use the app's features.

### Installation

+ Download the app from the latest [Release](https://github.com/GeorgeMC2610/BenzinApp/releases).
+ Install the app on your Android device.
+ Open the app and create an account.
+ Once you fill all the data needed for an account, you can start inputting data.

## Usage

### Consumption Calculation
Once you're in the app, you can tap on **History** (the second button on the navbar) and then the + button, to add a top-up record. Make sure that you have something like a receipt or a photo to remember how many kilometers the car travelled before the previous top-up, how many liters you filled, and how much it cost. Once you do that, you can see your car's consumption.

### Services & Malfunctions
You can store data about the car's repair history or malfunctions, in the "Services & Malfunctions" tab. In a later update, I might add the ability to add notifications & reminder with these.

### Repeated Trips
If you want to calculate a trip's consumption and cost, you can use the Trips section to do so. You can add either a one-time trip or a repeating one, to see how much it costs to travel from one place to another. To add a trip, you can select two points on the map and then the app will create the trip and calculate its cost.
