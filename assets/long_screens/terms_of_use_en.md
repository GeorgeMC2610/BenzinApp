Last updated: **10th of January 2026**

## 1. Introduction

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of **BenzinApp** (the “App”), developed and operated by **SEIMENIS GEORGIOS EMMANOUIL** (“we,” “us,” or “our”).

By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least **18 years old** to use the App.

By using the App, you confirm that:

- You have the legal right to use and enter the vehicle data provided
- You are legally permitted to use location-based services on your device


## 3. Description of the App

The App provides tools for:

- Recording vehicle-related data (fuel fills, malfunctions, services/check-ups)
- Logging and reviewing trips, including geographic coordinates
- Displaying routes and locations using Google Maps
- Optional real-time location tracking for trip-related features

The App is intended for **informational and organizational purposes only**.

## 4. No Professional or Diagnostic Advice

The App **does not provide mechanical, diagnostic, safety, legal, or professional advice**.

You acknowledge that:

- Vehicle data may be incomplete or inaccurate
- The App does not replace professional vehicle inspection or maintenance
- Any decisions you make based on App data **are at your own risk**

## 5. User Responsibilities

### a. Data Entry
You are responsible for:

- The accuracy of the data you enter
- Maintaining the security of your device
- Ensuring that your use of the App complies with applicable laws

You agree not to misuse the App or use it in a way that could cause harm, damage, or legal liability.

### b. User Accounts and Security
To access the features of the App, you will be required to create an account using an email address and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.

You agree not to share your password with third parties and to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

Information related to account credentials is processed and protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

### c. Account Verification, Recovery and Security Measures
The App will require account **verification** with E-Mail confirmation, to activate or maintain access to certain features.

Password reset functionality is provided to help users regain access to their accounts. You are responsible for **maintaining access** to the email address associated with your account.

For security reasons, accounts may be temporarily or permanently locked or restricted, including in cases of suspected unauthorized access, misuse, or violation of these Terms.

We are not responsible for loss of access resulting from failure to maintain accurate account information or from security measures applied to protect user accounts.

### d. Legacy Account Recovery
All users must create a new account to use the App. Users who previously held accounts under an earlier system (“Legacy Accounts”) may be offered the option to recover access to vehicles associated with those accounts.

Legacy Account recovery requires successful authentication using the original username and password associated with the prior account. You acknowledge that access to vehicles linked to Legacy Accounts is contingent upon providing valid and accurate legacy credentials. Once that is successfully done, the corresponding Legacy Account will then be tied to the newly created account.

You are **solely responsible** for maintaining, safeguarding, and correctly entering their Legacy Account credentials.

If you become aware of or suspect unauthorized access to a Legacy Account, you must notify us immediately. In such cases, we may require you to verify ownership of the associated vehicle using original account or vehicle-related data.

### e. Shared Vehicles & Data Access
The App allows users to **share** vehicle records with other registered and confirmed users by invitation. When a sharing invitation is accepted, the invited user may be **granted access to view, modify, or delete** vehicle-related data associated with the shared vehicle.

You acknowledge and agree that granting shared access **may allow another user to permanently modify or delete vehicle data.** Such actions may be **irreversible**.

You are **solely** responsible for deciding with whom you share vehicle access and for the consequences of sharing. We are not responsible for data loss, modification, or deletion resulting from shared access between users.

### f. Vehicle Ownership Transfer

The App allows a **vehicle’s ownership to be transferred** from one user to another. When ownership is transferred, the receiving user becomes the vehicle’s owner within the App and may gain full control over the vehicle data, including the ability to modify, delete, or share it with others.

You acknowledge that transferring ownership may result in the original owner losing access to the vehicle and its associated data. Ownership transfers **are irreversible**.

You are solely responsible for initiating ownership transfers and for resolving any disputes arising from such transfers. We are not responsible for loss of access or data resulting from ownership transfer between users.

Location access is optional but required for these features to function.

The App uses **Google Maps Platform APIs**, and your use of map features is subject to Google’s applicable terms and policies.
